# Challenges in KDD and ML for Sustainable Development



# Summary

Artificial Intelligence and machine learning techniques can offer powerful tools for addressing the greatest challenges facing humanity and helping society adapt to a rapidly changing climate, respond to disasters and pandemic crisis, and ultimately reach the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.  In recent approaches for mitigation and adaptation, data analytics and ML are only one part of the solution that requires interdisciplinary and methodological research and innovations. 
 
 For example, challenges include  multi-modal and multi-source data fusion to combine satellite imagery with other relevant data, 
   handling noisy and missing ground data at various spatio-temporal scales, and ensembling multiple physical and ML models to improve prediction accuracy.  Despite successes, there are many areas where ML is not applicable, performs poorly or gives insights that are not actionable. 
   
 This tutorial will survey the recent and significant contributions in ML across domain areas and scenarios of understanding and promoting sustainable development and we will present cross-cutting approaches and some lessons learned so far. 
Finally, we will highlight current challenges that need to be addressed to transform and better equip engaged sustainability science with robust ML-based tools to support actionable  decision-making.

### [Laure Berti-Equille](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/~laure.berti/) 
Laure a Research Director in Computer Science at IRD, the French Institute of interdisciplinary Research on Sustainability Science (since 2011) where she leads a research group. Created in 1943, IRD has been working on sustainability research on the field and with close partnerships with the main actors of developing countries.  Before, Laure was a full Professor in CS at Aix-Marseille University (AMU) in France (2017-2018). From 2014-2017, she was a Senior Scientist of Qatar Computing Research Institute. From 2000-2010, she was a tenured Associate Professor in CS at University of Rennes 1 in France, and a 2-years visiting researcher at AT\&T Labs Research in New Jersey, USA, as a recipient of the prestigious European Marie Curie Outgoing Fellowship (2007-2009). Her research work is at the intersection of large-scale data analytics and machine learning with a focus on data quality, data cleaning and preparation, and research applied to SDGs supported by many collaborations with industries and more than 80 publications and three monographs.  

### [David Dao](https://daviddao.org/)
David is a PhD student in Computer Science at ETH Zurich and founder of GainForest, a non-profit developing decentralized technology to reverse deforestation with pilot projects in South America and South-East Asia. His research focuses on the deployment of novel machine learning systems for nature and he collaborates with the United Nations and the Government of Chile. His research has been supported by multiple Microsoft AI for Earth grants and fellowships at UC Berkeley and Oasis Labs. David served as co-organizer of the "Tackling Climate Change with ML" workshop at ICLR2020 and the EcoPaDL workshop at ICML2020, as well as the lead organizer for the "Tackling Climate Change with ML" workshop at NeurIPS2020, and is a core member of Climate Change AI, a Global Shaper at World Economic Forum and a Climate Leader at Climate Reality. He is a former researcher at UC Berkeley and Stanford University.

### [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon/)
Stefano is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science in the CS Department at Stanford University, where he is affiliated with the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and a fellow of the Woods Institute for the Environment. His research is centered on techniques for probabilistic modeling of data and is motivated by applications in the emerging field of computational sustainability. He has won several awards, including four Best Paper Awards (AAAI, UAI and CP), a NSF Career Award, ONR and AFOSR Young Investigator Awards, a Sony Faculty Innovation Award, a Hellman Faculty Fellowship, Microsoft Research Fellowship, Sloan Fellowship, and the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award. Stefano earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Cornell University in 2015.


### [Bedartha Goswami](https://machineclimate.de/people/goswami/)
Bedartha leads the independent research group "Machine Learning in Climate Science," established in January 2020 within the Cluster of Excellence “Machine Learning” at the University of Tübingen. The group aims to extend and develop machine learning tools and techniques to quantify and unravel complex climate systems. Bedartha has previously worked at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) with Dr. Norbert Marwan and Prof. Dr. Dr. h.c. Jürgen Kurths, and at the Institute of Geosciences, University of Potsdam with Prof. Dr. Bodo Bookhagen. Bedartha is an experienced researcher on uncertainties in climate and paleoclimate data sets, classical statistics, machine learning, nonlinear time series analysis, and complex networks.
